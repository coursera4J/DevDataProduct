## About the dataset (mtcars)
* The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 other features for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
* 11 data columns representing fuel comsumption (mpg) and other aspects of automobile design and performance.


```
##  [1] "mpg"  "cyl"  "disp" "hp"   "drat" "wt"   "qsec" "vs"   "am"   "gear"
## [11] "carb"
```

* Question to Answer: How an individual feature may impact the fuel consumption?
* Can we come up with a model to predict the impact?

## Exploratory data analysis with plots
* Relationshps of Fuel Consumption with: "number of cylinders", "transmission type", "horsepower", and "weight".

## Build Linear Regression Model with R
* The exploratory data analysis indicates a linear relatonship might exist, for example, between the fuel consumption (mpg) and the weight (wt).

* R provides a function (i.e. "lm") to easily build a linear regression model.


```r
wtModel<-lm(mpg~wt, data=mtcars)
wtModel$coefficient
```

```
## (Intercept)          wt 
##      37.285      -5.344
```


---

## Plot the Regression Model
* R also provides easy ways to visulize the regression model.
* Here is an example of using ggplot to plot the linear regression model.

```r
qplot(wt, mpg, data=mtcars, geom=c("point", "smooth"), method="lm")
```
